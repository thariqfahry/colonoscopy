# colonoscopy
Code for our award-winning, record-breaking MECH2636 Colonoscopy project @ Uni of Leeds.

## Overview
We design a 2-DoF robotic arm to guide a magnetic ball through a plastic colon. This simulates how colonoscopies could be performed with ingestible robots, with the ball representing the ingestible camera and the arm representing the magnetic guide.

We beat the University of Leeds record for speed with our design, and are the current record holders.

| Run      | Time (s) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Ours, final | 4.2 |
| Previous record holder | 7.5 |
